# Trump_vs_climate_web_scraping_project
A web scraping project in Scrapy, looking at trends in energy generation before and during the Trump administration.

Four different scrapers built in Scrapy to handle the sites in different areas of the US Energy Information Administration website. 

Exploratory data analysis included plotting with Plotly, using two-sample t-test to form conclusions and time series decomposition to round out those conclusions.
